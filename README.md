**Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography** 
Hello, I'm Harshwardhan Zanwar from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. Welcome to my project—a tool that lets you hide secret messages within images without drawing any attention. This capstone project is designed to make secure communication both simple and subtle.

**Overview**
Imagine being able to pass along a secret note without anyone suspecting a thing. That’s exactly what this project does—it hides messages inside images so discreetly that no one would know a secret lies within. Developed as my capstone project at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur, this tool not only safeguards your data but does so in a way that's accessible to everyone. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a journalist, or just someone intrigued by digital security, you're in the right place.

**Features**
Discreet Messaging: Hide your messages within images without leaving any noticeable trace.
Friendly Interface: Enjoy an intuitive GUI, built with Tkinter, that makes encryption and decryption a breeze.
Lossless Process: Employs pixel manipulation to ensure your image retains its original quality.
Wide Compatibility: Works seamlessly with all standard image formats (PNG is recommended for best results).
Password Protection: Adds an extra layer of security with a simple password-based encryption.
Technologies We Used
Python: Our reliable and versatile programming language.
OpenCV: Handles the magic of image processing and manipulation.
Tkinter: Powers the easy-to-use graphical interface.
Pillow: Assists with robust image handling.
Basic Encryption Logic: Provides simple yet effective password protection for your hidden messages.

**Where We’re Headed**
I'm excited about the future and have several ideas to enhance this tool:
Stronger Encryption: Introducing advanced methods like AES encryption for extra security.
Beyond Images: Extending the technique to include audio and video files.
Smart Security: Integrating AI to further obscure hidden messages.
Mobile and Web Versions: Expanding the tool’s accessibility across different platforms.
Extra Layers of Protection: Combining steganography with blockchain for ultra-secure communication.
